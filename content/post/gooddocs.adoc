Six characteristics of good docs:
  
* *Findable* - a user needs to be able to get to those docs when a problem or curiosity creates a need for information
* *Accessible* - legal accessibility and language accessibility
* *Scannable* - web users do not read, they scan
* *Searchable* - in todayâ€™s world, no one wants to thumb or scroll through a 600-page manual. They search instead
* *Timely* - good docs are timely, they provide the right information that the user needs at this moment
* *Complete* - good docs have all of the information a user might need to get from the beginning to the end of their use of the product, tool, or software.
